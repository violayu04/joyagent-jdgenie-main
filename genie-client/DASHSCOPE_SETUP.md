## üîß Alternative: Use Free Local Model

If you prefer not to use cloud APIs, you can set up Ollama with Qwen locally:

### Install Ollama
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull Qwen model
ollama pull qwen:7b
```

### Configure for Local Use
Update your `.env` file:
```
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=local
QWEN_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
QWEN_MODEL=qwen:7b
```

## üìù Notes
- DashScope is Alibaba Cloud's AI platform
- It provides official access to Qwen models
- Free tier is usually sufficient for testing
- Production usage may require paid credits

## üÜò Troubleshooting
- Make sure your API key is valid
- Check your account has sufficient credits
- Verify network connectivity to Alibaba Cloud
- Try different Qwen models if one doesn't work
